.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is used to create a Primary Object under one of the Primary Seeds or a Temporary Object under TPM_RH_NULL. The command uses a TPM2B_PUBLIC as a template for the object to be created. The command will create and load a Primary Object. The sensitive area is not returned.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-A\fR,\ \fB\-\-auth\fR=[o|p|e|n]
Specify the hierarchy under which the object is created. This will also dictate which authorization secret (if any) must be supplied.
.br
Supported options are:
  'o' for TPM_RH_OWNER
  'p' for TPM_RH_PLATFORM
  'e' for TPM_RH_ENDORSEMENT
  'n' for TPM_RH_NULL
.TP
\fB\-P\fR,\ \fB\-\-pwdp\fR=[string]
Optional authorization string if authorization is required to create object under the specified hierarchy.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR,\ \fB\-\-pwdk\fR=[string]
Optional authorization string for the newly created object.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR,\ \fB\-\-halg\fR=[0x4|0xB|0xC|0xD|0x12]
Hash algorithm used in the computation of the object name.
.br
Supported options are:
  '0x4' for TPM_ALG_SHA1
  '0xB' for TPM_ALG_SHA256
  '0xC' for TPM_ALG_SHA384
  '0xD' for TPM_ALG_SHA512
  '0x12' for TPM_ALG_SM3_256
.br
\fBNOTE\fR: Your TPM may not support all algorithms.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR,\ \fB\-\-kalg\fR=[0x1|0x8|0x23|0x25] 
Algorithm type for generated key.
.br
Supported options are:
  '0x1' for TPM_ALG_RSA
  '0x8' for TPM_ALG_KEYEDHASH
  '0x23' for TPM_ALG_ECC
  '0x25' for TPM_ALG_SYMCIPHER
.TP
\fB\-C\fR,\ \fB\-\-context\fR=[filepath]
An optional file used to store the object context returned.
.TP
\fB\-X\fR,\ \fB\-\-passwdInHex\fR
A flag used to indicate that the supplied passwords are hex strings.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR,\ \fB\-\-policy\-file\fR=[filepath]
An optional file input that contains the policy digest for policy based authorization of the object.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR,\ \fB\-\-enforce\-policy\fR
Option to enforce policy based authorization on the created primary object.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR,\ \fB\-\-input-session-handle\fR
Optional Input session handle from a policy session for authorization.
